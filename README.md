# Helferlein - A Discord Bot for my Dorm :)

Made with Javascript and ![DiscordJS](https://discord.js.org/#/)

## Background 

I live in a Dorm with around 27 people on my floor (although not all of them always live there). <br>
In times of Covid-19 it was especially difficult, since we were only allowed to use our common room and kitchen areas to cook, while always having to wear a mask. <br>
The student council of our Dorm came up with a concept for the SS21 (summer semester 2021), every person who was fully vaccinated or had theirself tested every 4 days
would be allowed to use the common room regularly and participate in small gatherings there.


I then decided to create this Discord Bot to make it easier to keep track of the Tests. <br>
People would be able to submit their test results by sending it as a direct message with a command and an attachment (either a pdf or image) to the Bot. <br>
The Test Results would then be redirected to the "Floor Speakers" for confirmation and automatically kept track of in a List


## How it looked like - Some Examples

### Submitting a Test

### Validating a Test

(By reacting to the message -> when accepted the person was notified)
