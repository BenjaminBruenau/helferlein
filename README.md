# Helferlein - A Discord Bot for my Dorm :)

## Background 

I live in a Dorm with around 27 people on my floor (although not all of them always live there).
In times of Covid-19 it was especially difficult, since we were only allowed to use our common room and kitchen areas to cook, while always haveing to wear a mask.
The studen council of our Dorm came up with a concept for the SS21 (summer semester 2021), every person who was fully vaccinated or had theirself tested every 4 days
would be allowed to use the common room regulary and participate in small gatherings there).

I then decided to create this Discord Bot to make it easier to keep track of the Tests.
People would be able to submit their test results by sending it as a direct message with a command and an attachment (either a pdf or image) to the Bot.
The Test Results would then be redirected to the "Floor Speakers" for confirmation and automatically kept track of in a List
